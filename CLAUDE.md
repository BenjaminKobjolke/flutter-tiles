# Coding Rules (Pointer)

This project's rules live in two files in the project root:

- `CODING_RULES.md` — code quality and conventions. BINDING for all code work in
  this repository, always.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md` — the end-to-end flow to follow when planning and
  implementing a change (checks, gates, Definition of Done).

MANDATORY: Before writing or editing ANY code, you MUST Read BOTH files in full
**in the current session**. Do not rely on memory of a previous session, a
summary, or partial reads.

If you are about to make a code change and have not read both files in this
session: STOP, read them, then continue.

An external tool may orchestrate the implementation itself. When a skill or run
states that the implementation is orchestrated, ignore `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`
entirely — the orchestrator runs those steps as its own phases. `CODING_RULES.md`
stays binding either way.

Next to `CODING_RULES.md`, apply also writes `CODING_RULES_PLAN.md`,
`CODING_RULES_REVIEW.md` and `CODING_RULES_CODE.md`. When an orchestrator's run
instructions name one of these step files, that file replaces `CODING_RULES.md`
for that run; without such an instruction, `CODING_RULES.md` stays binding in full.

Do not inline rules back into this file and do not use `@import` for either file —
they are intentionally referenced, not imported.

## Code Analysis

After implementing a feature, finishing a plan, or fixing a bug, run the changed-files analyzer and fix reported issues before considering the work complete:

```powershell
cmd /c '.\tools\analyze_changed_and_new_files.bat'
```

This uses `--only-changed` to report findings in files new or modified against Git `HEAD`.
Run `tools/analyze_code.bat` for a full project audit, before a release or merge, or after a refactor that touches shared code.
Analyzer reports are per-rule CSV files in `code_analysis_results/`; a missing CSV means that rule found no issues.
